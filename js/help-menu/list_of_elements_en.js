      <h2>Search Tips</h2>
      <tl>
      <li>Combine, expand, or limit your search through the operators AND, OR, NOT. Please remember to write the operators with capital letters.</li>
      <li>Use * as a wildcard character to search for variants of a word, for instance <i>pest*</i> (pester, pesticide, pestilence, etc.)</li>
      <li>Use ? as a wildcard to replace a single letter, for instance <i>wom?n</i> for <i>woman</i> and <i>women</i>.</li>
      <li>Use (...) parenthesis to group query words, for instance <i>Government AND (democracy OR cabinet responsibility)</i>.</li>
      <li>Use "..." quotation marks, if you want to search for a compound term, for instance <i>"global warming"</i>.</li>
      </tl>
      <br />
      <h2>Too many results?</h2>
      <li>Use the filtering features to the left of the results list to limit your results by type of material, author, subject, year, library, etc.</li>
      <li>Find more search tips on our <a href="https://www.kb.dk/services/laan-og-aflevering/hjaelp-til-soegning" target="_blank">general services page</a>.</li>
